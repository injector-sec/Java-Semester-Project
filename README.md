Shopping Cart Management System

Overview

The Shopping Cart Management System is a Java Swing application that simulates the functions of an e-commerce store's cart. This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles by allowing users to add products to a cart, calculate costs, search for products, and generate the total bill.
